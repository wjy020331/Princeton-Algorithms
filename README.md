The source code of homework and my own notes

## How To Use

[Course address](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/) is here, please check on this website and get the complete homework message.

You'd better download the IDEA CE 2022.2 **which the profressor gived!** Otherwise, you cannot use the command like:

```bash
$ javac-algs4 Example.java
```

The origin data is in the directory "/hello". For each lab, I possibly cover the origin data.

## Addition

If there is any mistake in my code or something can be improved. email me at **ethan.jingyu@gmail.com**, I'd appreciate all your contribution!
